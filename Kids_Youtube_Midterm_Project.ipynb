## Project Description

This project analyzes YouTube videos targeting children to uncover trends in viewer engagement using statistical methods. The dataset includes metadata such as views, likes, dislikes, comments, and publication dates, filtered from a larger dataset to include only child-appropriate content.

### Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scipy.stats`
- Google Colab for cloud-based notebook execution
- GitHub for dataset and version control

## Analysis Structure

The notebook follows a consistent, professor-recommended format:

1. **State the Question**  
   Each step begins with a clear statistical or data-driven question.

2. **Show the Code**  
   Clean, commented Python code is used for analysis and visualization.

3. **Provide the Interpretation**  
   Outputs are interpreted in plain language to explain what the statistics or plots reveal.

## Results

- **Descriptive Stats**: Means, medians, and standard deviations of views, likes, and comment counts.
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, boxplots, regression plots, pair plots, and time series.
- **Statistical Analysis**: 
  - Linear regression between likes and views.
  - Probability calculations for viewership and engagement thresholds.
  - Conditional probabilities based on category.

## Notes

- The project investigates **engagement metrics** (likes, comments, etc.) in **child-targeted YouTube videos**.
- The dataset is **hosted on GitHub** and successfully integrated into the **Google Colab** environment for reproducible analysis.
- All DataFrame variables in the notebook use the alias `data` for clarity and consistency.
