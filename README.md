## About the Project  
This project examines engagement trends in YouTube videos specifically made for children. As a parent and student, I was personally interested in understanding how media exposure impacts children. I analyzed the distribution of views, likes, and comments, as well as patterns among categories and popular channels.

## Dataset  
- **Filename**: `Filtered_Kids_Youtube_Videos.csv`  
- **Hosted on Google Drive**: [Download CSV File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JOI9cBck2VYqkgoYpyu4cnWcOyLZcphL/view?usp=sharing)  
- **Description**: A cleaned and filtered subset of trending YouTube videos tailored for children. Includes metrics such as views, likes, dislikes, comments, channel titles, category ID, and publish time.

## Project Structure (Notebook)  
The notebook follows a structured, step-by-step approach for clarity and evaluation:

1. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**  
   - Loaded the dataset  
   - Converted `publish_time` to datetime  
   - Removed unused columns and handled missing values

2. **Measures of Central Tendency**  
   - Q1: What is the average number of views?  
   - Q2: What is the median number of likes?  
   - Q3: What is the most common category ID?

3. **Measures of Spread**  
   - Q4: What is the standard deviation of views?  
   - Q5: What is the IQR of comment counts?

4. **Visualizations**  
   - Q6: Pairplot of views, likes, dislikes, and comments  
   - Q7: Histogram of view distribution  
   - Q8: Boxplot of likes across category IDs  
   - Q9: Time series of total views per day

5. **Scatterplot with Linear Regression**  
   - Q10: Is there a linear relationship between likes and views?  
   - Predicted views for a video with 100,000 likes

6. **Probability Analysis**  
   - Q11: P(video has >1M views)  
   - Q12: P(likes >100k AND comments >10k)  
   - Q13: P(views >1M | category 24)  
   - Q14: P(dislikes >10k OR comments >20k)

7. **Freestyle Exploration**  
   - Q15: Which 10 channels receive the highest average number of likes?
