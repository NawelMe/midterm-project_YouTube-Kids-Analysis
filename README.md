# YouTube Kids Content Statistical Analysis

This repository contains the midterm project for **MAT 301: Applied Statistics and Data Analysis** at Lehman College, CUNY (Summer 2025). The project explores statistical patterns in a filtered dataset of trending YouTube videos targeted toward children.

## Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and wrangling to prepare a usable dataset
- Descriptive statistics and measures of central tendency and spread
- Multiple visualizations to examine trends and distributions
- A linear regression model to study relationships between variables
- Probability estimations based on the sample data
- Freestyle exploration of engagement patterns by channel

All steps are clearly organized and documented within the Jupyter Notebook using markdown cells and Python code.

## Instructions for Use

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Make sure the dataset file (`Filtered_Kids_Youtube_Videos.csv`) is accessible either by uploading it to Colab or linking your Google Drive.
3. Run the notebook section by section to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
4. Refer to the markdown explanations throughout for context and interpretation of the results.
