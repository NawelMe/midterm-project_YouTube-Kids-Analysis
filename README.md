## About the Project  
This project looks at how people engage with YouTube videos made for kids. As a parent and a student, I wanted to understand what kinds of videos get more views, likes, or comments. I used basic statistics to explore trends in the data, like which categories are most popular and which channels get the most likes.

## Dataset  
- **Filename**: `Filtered_Kids_Youtube_Videos.csv`  
- **Hosted on GitHub**: [Raw CSV Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NawelMe/midterm-project_YouTube-Kids-Analysis/main/Filtered_Kids_Youtube_Videos.csv)  
- **Description**: A smaller version of a bigger YouTube dataset that only includes videos for children. It has info like views, likes, comments, upload dates, and video categories.

## Project Structure (Notebook)  
The notebook is organized by sections that answer specific questions using code and basic statistics. Each section follows this format:

1. **State the Question** – What are we trying to find out?
2. **Show the Code** – Python code to analyze the data
3. **Provide the Interpretation** – A short explanation of what the results mean

### Main Sections:

- **Cleaning the Data**  
  Removed extra columns and made sure dates were formatted correctly.

- **Averages and Medians**  
  Looked at typical numbers of views, likes, and comments.

- **Spread and Variability**  
  Measured how much the numbers differ from each other.

- **Graphs and Visualizations**  
  Made plots to show distributions, trends over time, and comparisons by category.

- **Regression and Prediction**  
  Checked if there's a relationship between likes and views, and predicted views for a video with 100,000 likes.

- **Probability Questions**  
  Answered questions like “What’s the chance a video has over 1 million views?” or “How likely are high likes and high comments together?”

- **Extra Exploration**  
  Found the top 10 channels with the highest average likes.
